  A linear scaling, sometimes, might not be situable for visualizing data tendency which either increases or decreases nonlinearly. In this case, the data with lower value are too  
crowded around the bottom axis. Thus, an nonlinear works well eliminating the bias over the difference between the data with lower value.
