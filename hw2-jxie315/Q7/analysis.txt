Note: I use ggplot2, the graphing package in Rstudio, to make a comparsion to D3 and Tableau.

1.Ease to develop

R: The complex functionality over ggplot2, which takes into account issues coming from data structure, scaling, design, is difficult.

Taleau: The developer extremely goes after expanding the degree of usability and simplication. 

d3: The developers for d3 only build the functionality over data visualization problems. Operations can be diverse.

2.Ease to maintain the visualization

R: There is still easy to maintain visualization because ggplot2 only cares about parameters.
Tableau: No way to maintain visulization because there is no programming.
D3: the Best way to deal with dynamic data so far I have seen


3. Usability of visualization for ended users

R: easy, only parameters changing

Tableau: easy, only mouse clicking

d3: tough, I almost cry, fundamental programming


4.Scalability of visualiaztion to "large" datasets

R: actually not that easy, because it runs slowly when handling larger dataset

Tableau: Not good, algorithms does not work well for millions of data

d3: Good for me so far.

5.System requirments

R: I did go crazy to find out the problems on different versions.

Tableau: I need to pay money for using it !!

d3: free, no system requirments
